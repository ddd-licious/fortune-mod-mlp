Manehattan was simply grand. It was in this magnificent metropolis

your generosity, you should never, ever let that cause you to abandon

Rarity:           [unintelligible screeching] I can't!  [nervous laughing] Uh,
                  hi– [clears throat] Hello, Mr.  Trenderhoof. I am Rarity, and
                  I have been chosen as pony of ceremonies for the Ponyville
                  Days festival.  [nervous laughing]
Trenderhoof:      Please, call me 'Trend'.

Trenderhoof: Oh, breathtaking! I've heard about it of course, but to see it in
             vérité, to stand on the soil of a working farm... You can really
             feel the authenticity.
Rarity:      Oh, yes, uh, they, they really do grow apples here.

He doesn't like me because he has a crush on Applejack, even though I've had a
crush on him ever since the beginning of time, and it's not fair!

Oh, Spike, how could you ever know what it's like to be totally obsessed with a
pony only to find out they're obsessed with somepony else?

I once had an apple so rare, they thought it was extinct. I ate four of them.

Rarity:      If there's one thing I love, it's hauling apples!
Trenderhoof: [dreamily] I'm growing fond of it myself.
Applejack:   [under her breath] Maybe you two should try it sometime.

Trenderhoof: I'm feeling a tad inspired.

        Without farm life, there'd be such disparity
        These thoughts I think with great clarity

Rarity:    Right, so. [whips reins] Come on! [grunts] Farm... thing!  [sighs]
           Oh, how does Applejack do it?
Applejack: Well, it would help if the harness was on right!  What are you
           doin'?
Rarity:    I am simply lending a hoof with the chores, which I love doing ever
           so much.
Applejack: Well if you're still interested after the festival I can teach you
           all about it. But right now, I need to get the plowin' done, if you
           don't mind.

I am perfectly familiar with the apple-bucking process, thank you very much.
But while you seem to rely on raw power, I believe a certain amount of style is
required. It's really more of a dance, if you ask me. [happy 'hm'ing noises] Et
voilà!

Trenderhoof: Rarity, can I ask you something?
Rarity:      Oh, why, Trend, you can ask me anything.
Trenderhoof: I've been meaning to ask for a while, and frankly I'm sort of
             embarrassed. Rarity... do you think...  Applejack would be my date
             for the festival?

Rarity: [country accent] Firstly, I just want to thank you all for comin', and
        second, I know y'all will all adore my new festival theme!

Rarity:    [normal voice] Well of course I'm serious– [clears throat] [back in
           country accent] Why wouldn't I be?
Applejack: Because you would never dress like that. You like fashion and high
           society and fancy things.
Rarity:    And I can like plowin' fields and haulin' apples just as much.
Applejack: But you don't!

Rarity:    [normal voice] Because you would never wear an ensemble like that.

Organizing the Ponyville Day celebration was one of the hardest things I've
ever done. But I learned an important lesson. Real friends will like you for
who you are, and changing yourself to impress them is no way to make new ones.

The center of attention! A shining star! Everypony staring at you, judging you,
jealously noting how they could be way better than you? Why wasn't it them? Why
wasn't it them? And then, when you choke, they'll turn on you, becoming a
seething, angry mob, and you'll be horribly humiliated, never able to show your
face in Ponyville again!

forgave us, and, like magic, things are good as new! That's the kind of magic I

It's part of a very important, super-duper special tradition that only the
closest and bestest of friends can share. We're going to make rock candy
necklaces together! [squeals] It all started when Maud and I were fillies on
the rock farm. She taught me the Pie family rock candy recipe! It adds a secret
ingredient – [whispering] It's rocks!  [speaking normally] – And she showed me
how to string the pieces to make them into a necklace! And once we were done,
we'd trade! Maud and I have been trading necklaces back and forth since I moved
to Ponyville. They're a sign that we'll always be best friends!  [squee]

Rarity:    Well, since we can't both get what we want, I will be the better
           friend. You take our trade goods and get what you want.
Applejack: I'm an amazin' friend! So even though it's for somethin' that don't
           seem valuable at all, you take our stash.
Rarity:    How dare you let me get what I want. What kind of friend do you
           think I am? You are going to get what you want!

These books made Twilight the princess she is. Before that, she was nothing – a

Well, I took my half of our stash and got you this! And I know you're gonna

Spike. Never, ever, ever, ever take another book out of the library at the

You know, it's kinda weird. No matter how many times others tell you you're
great, all the praise in the world means nothing if you don't feel it inside.
[inhales] [breathes fire] Sometimes to feel good about yourself, you gotta let
go of the past. That way, when the time comes
