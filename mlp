Pinkie Pie:       Well, I heard that Zecora eats hay.
Twilight Sparkle: Pinkie, I eat hay; you eat hay!
Pinkie Pie:       Yeah, but I heard it's the evil way she eats hay.

Pegasus:      Ditzy Doo accidentally went north to get the southern birds!
Rainbow Dash: Oh that featherbrain. Didn't she learn her lesson last year

Twilight Sparkle: Is your knee pinchy now?
Pinkie Pie:	  No, but my shoulder is achy. That means there is an

Spike:		  Oh, sorry, but, um, well, isn't that what you're doing?

Pinkie Pie: 	  [giggles] Silly, that would've spoiled the secret!
	-- MLP:FiM S01E15
